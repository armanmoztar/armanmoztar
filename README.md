## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Arman and I'm a fourth-year student at the University of British Columbia. My interests lie in computer science, data science... and anything in tech really.
Here's a little bit about me:

- Currently working at Amazon as an SDE Intern
- TA'd courses on computer networking and cloud computing
- Current GitHub Campus Expert for the Vancouver Campus at UBC
- Avid soccer fan (currently watching the Euros) 
- Enjoy skiing, music, and hiking
